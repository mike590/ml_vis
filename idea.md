have an equation with number inputs for the weights. Graph the current equation. Have a slider input for error. Highlight the graph in red, with a width proportional to the error. User chooses how many points to generate (lot 10000, medium 1000, little 100), hits generate, animate the points appearing on the graph. Then begin linear regression. Show current equation (with current theta values), and show the thetas changing as it goes. If it takes any appreciable amount of time to caluclate on each run through gradient descent, animate the points by changing their individual color as they are checked for error. Once it is complete, show how far off it was.

Explain the steps of linear regression. You can explain what it is doing each time as it runs through process, helping people visualize it.
